## About Yourself
<b>1.“Good morning! Please introduce yourself.”</b>

“Good morning Sir, I am V. Saikumar. I am currently located in Tambaram. I completed my schooling at NSN Matric, Chitalapakkam, and I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at Saveetha Engineering College. I am very interested in .NET development and I strongly believe in continuous learning and improving my skills.

I worked on a project called Student Management Record using ASP.NET MVC, where I handled backend logic and database integration to manage student information efficiently. This helped me strengthen my web development and MVC skills.”

<b>2.Why should we hire you?</b>
“You should hire me because I have a strong foundation in .NET development, I have hands-on experience with my project using ASP.NET MVC, and I am always eager to learn and adapt quickly. I am confident that I can contribute effectively to the team and grow along with the company.”

<b>3.your strenght and weakness</b>

“My strength is my willingness to learn and adapt, and I am also dedicated and focused, which helps me complete tasks efficiently. For example, while working on my Student Management Record project, I learned ASP.NET MVC and database integration independently to complete the backend logic.
At the same time, one area I’m working on improving is public speaking. I used to feel nervous while explaining my ideas, but I’ve been practicing by explaining my projects and concepts to friends and mentors, and I’m becoming much more confident.”

## .NET questions

### About design principles 

<b> 1.what are design principles</b>

“Design principles in C# are used to make applications maintainable, reusable, testable, and scalable. They help in writing clean and loosely coupled code. For example, using SOLID principles improves flexibility and allows easy feature additions without modifying existing code.”

## .NET CORE Questions
<b>1.What is the difference between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET 5/6/7?</b>
.NET Framework

Released in early 2000s.

Works only on Windows.

Used for ASP.NET Web Forms, WPF, WinForms, etc.

It’s stable but no longer actively developed with new features.

.NET Core

Introduced in 2016.

Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS).

Open-source and lightweight.

Suitable for web apps, APIs, microservices, and cloud apps.

.NET 5/6/7 (Unified .NET)

From 2020 onwards, Microsoft merged everything into a single platform called .NET.

Example: .NET 5, 6 (LTS), 7, and now .NET 8.

Combines .NET Framework and .NET Core features → one framework for desktop, web, mobile, cloud, IoT.

<b>2.Explain the ASP.NET MVC Request Lifecycle.
(How does a request from a browser go through MVC and return a response?)</b>

*"In ASP.NET MVC, when a request comes in to the Controller action method is called. Inside this method, the controller usually interacts with the Model to fetch data from the database.
Once the data is retrieved, the controller passes it to the View, which is typically a Razor .cshtml page.

<b>3.What is Entity Framework?</b>

*"Entity Framework (EF) is an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) from Microsoft. It allows developers to work with databases using C# objects instead of writing raw SQL queries. EF automatically translates LINQ queries into SQL and handles data access, so we don’t have to write ADO.NET code manually.

There are two common approaches:

Code First → We start by writing our C# classes (models), then EF generates the database schema. If we change the model, we use migrations to update the database.

Database First → We start with an existing database, and EF generates the models (classes) and context from the database schema."*

👉 Short version (if they want quick): “Entity Framework lets me interact with the database using C# objects. Code First starts from code → DB, Database First starts from DB → code.”




## Javascript Basics

<b>1.“What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript?”</b>

“Synchronous JavaScript executes code line by line, where each statement must finish before the next runs. Asynchronous JavaScript, on the other hand, allows tasks like timers, API calls, or file operations to run in the background without blocking the main thread. The results are later handled using callbacks, promises, or async/await.”

<b>2.“What is a Promise in JavaScript, and why is it used?”</b>

“A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It has three states: pending (initial), fulfilled (resolved successfully), and rejected (failed). Promises help manage asynchronous code in a cleaner way, avoiding deeply nested callbacks.”

<b>3.“What is the difference between Promises and async/await in JavaScript?”</b>

“Promises are objects that represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation, with three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. async/await is syntactic sugar over promises that makes asynchronous code look synchronous: async marks a function as asynchronous, and await pauses execution until the promise resolves, without blocking the main thread.”

<b>4.“Can you explain the Event Loop in JavaScript and how it handles asynchronous tasks?”</b>

“The Event Loop in JavaScript continuously checks the call stack. When the stack is empty, it takes tasks from the callback queue or microtask queue (like resolved promises) and pushes them to the stack for execution. This allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread.”

<b>5.“What is callback hell, and how do Promises solve it?”</b>

“Callback hell happens when we have many nested callbacks in asynchronous code, making it hard to read, maintain, and debug. Promises solve this problem by allowing us to chain asynchronous operations using .then() and .catch(), which keeps the code flat and more readable.”

<b>6. What is the difference between var, let, and const?</b>

var → function-scoped, can be redeclared, hoisted.

let → block-scoped, cannot be redeclared in same scope, not hoisted like var.

const → block-scoped, cannot be redeclared or reassigned, must be initialized.

<b>7. What is hoisting in JavaScript?</b>

“Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behavior of moving declarations (variables and functions) to the top of their scope before execution. Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.”

<b>8. What is the difference between == and ===?</b>

== → compares values 

=== → compares value and type 

<b>9. What are closures?</b>

“A closure is a function that can use variables from its outer function, even after the outer function has finished running.”

<b>10. What is the difference between null and undefined?</b>

undefined → variable declared but not assigned a value.

null → intentional absence of a value, assigned by developer.
